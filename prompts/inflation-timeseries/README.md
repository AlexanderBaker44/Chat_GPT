# Prompts and responses to generate ML prediction code for inflation.

### notes:

- prompts were done in backwrards order :facepalm:
- likely will need to manually specify the format of the data.
- will need to add more specificity to chatgpt prompts to store artifacts and allow for a proper mlops pipeline.
- still intuitively seems like code reuse ought to be a library as opposed to a generative model


## Prompt 1:
#### Prompt: create python code to train a machine learning model that predicts inflation rates



Sure, here's an example of how to train a machine learning model in Python to predict inflation rates:
First, let's import the necessary libraries:
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Next, we need to load our dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
python
data = pd.read_csv('inflation_data.csv')

Assuming that the dataset has two columns, one for the year and another for the inflation rate, we can split the data into our features (the year) and our target variable (the inflation rate):
python
X = data['year'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['inflation_rate'].values.reshape(-1,1)

Now, we can split our data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn:
python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

We can then create an instance of the LinearRegression() class and fit our training data to the model:
python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Once our model has been trained, we can use it to make predictions on the test data:
python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

Finally, we can calculate the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate how well our model is performing:
python
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)

And that's it! This is a simple example of how to train a machine learning model in Python to predict inflation rates using linear regression. However, keep in mind that there are many other models and techniques that could be used to improve the accuracy of your predictions.

## Prompt 2
#### Prompt: Where would you find inflation time series data for the previous machine learning model?

There are many sources of inflation time series data that you could use for your machine learning model. Here are a few options:
World Bank: The World Bank provides a wide range of economic indicators, including inflation rates, for many countries around the world. You can access this data through their data portal, which allows you to download the data in various formats including CSV and Excel.
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED): FRED is a database of economic data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. It includes inflation data for the United States and many other countries. You can access this data through their website or through their API.
International Monetary Fund (IMF): The IMF provides a range of economic data, including inflation rates, for its member countries. You can access this data through their website or through their API.
National Statistical Offices: Many countries have their own national statistical offices that collect and publish economic data, including inflation rates. You can search for these offices online or check with your local library or university for access to their data.
These are just a few examples of sources of inflation time series data. It's important to make sure that the data you choose is reliable and accurate, and that it covers the time period and geographic area that you are interested in.

## Prompt 3:
#### Prompt: create python code to download a CSV file of inflation data from one of the previous sources

Sure, here's an example of how to download a CSV file of inflation data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) in Python:
First, let's import the necessary libraries:
python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web

Next, we need to specify the data that we want to download. For example, if we want to download the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the United States, we can use the FRED code "CPALTT01USM657NUPN" as follows:
python
start_date = '2000-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'
fred_code = 'CPALTT01USM657NUPN'

We can then use the DataReader() function from pandas_datareader to download the data as a pandas DataFrame:
python
inflation_data = web.DataReader(fred_code, 'fred', start_date, end_date)

The DataReader() function will automatically download the data from FRED and return it as a pandas DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame will have one column, which contains the inflation rates for each date.
Finally, we can save the DataFrame as a CSV file using the to_csv() function:
python
inflation_data.to_csv('inflation_data.csv')

And that's it! This code will download inflation data from FRED and save it as a CSV file in the current directory. You can change the start and end dates, as well as the FRED code, to download different inflation data. Note that you may need to install pandas_datareader library if you haven't done so yet. You can install it using the command pip install pandas-datareader.
